# WeatherReact

This app is a completed version of the Weather app in Stephen Grider's [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) course that I can recommend to anyone who wants React/Redux explained clearly.

This app is based on Stephen Grider's starter kit for React/Redux, that you can get [here](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReactStarter)

This original starter kit is using very old versions of React and other frameworks.
[Here's a fork](https://github.com/roelver/ReduxSimpleStarter) with updated versions as per August,2 2017.
